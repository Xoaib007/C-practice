## Pointer

Pointer is a special kind of variavble that stores the memory location of a variable.
A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is created with the * operator.

```C
int myAge = 43;     // An int variable
int *ptr = &myAge;  // A pointer variable, with the name ptr, that stores the address of myAge

// Output the value of myAge (43)
printf("%d\n", myAge);

// Output the memory address of myAge (0x7ffe5367e044)
printf("%p\n", &myAge);

// Output the memory address of myAge with the pointer (0x7ffe5367e044)
printf("%p\n", ptr);
```

Here ptr is a pointer that points to an int variable myAge. & operator is useed to store the memory address of the myAge variable, and assign it to the pointer.
